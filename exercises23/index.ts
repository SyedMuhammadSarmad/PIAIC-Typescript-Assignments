//Question 23
/*Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. 
Your code should look something like this:

let car = 'subaru';

console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")

console.log(car == 'subaru')

• Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.

• Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.*/

let age = 18;

//5 tests evaluate to True
console.log(18 == age)

console.log(16<age)

console.log(age % 2 == 0)

console.log(typeof(age) == 'number')

console.log(typeof(age) != 'string')

//5 tests evaluate to False
console.log(18 != age)

console.log(16>age)

console.log(age % 2 != 0)

console.log(typeof(age) != 'number')

console.log(typeof(age) == 'string')
